This is my first substantial project using React.js. The gist is providing users with local weather data in animated, interactive graphs created with D3.js. Obviously, this is nothing a simple Google search couldn't accomplish in less time, but I enjoyed creating an app that made practicle use of APIs while implementing React with D3 to generate an aesthetic, interactive, and practical app. I hope you enjoy it!

The app itself can be reached at https://weatherapp-302215.uc.r.appspot.com/ if you want to check it out.

NPM comes with a lot of files, hence all the beef in here. the only files you care about are these:   https://github.com/stepianno/weather_app/blob/main/src/welcome.js  
https://github.com/stepianno/weather_app/blob/main/src/App.css  
https://github.com/stepianno/weather_app/blob/main/src/index.js  

The welcome.js page is admittedly far too long and inappropriately named. If I were to do this project again, or for future projects, I would certainly break this page into multiple files that can be imported to make it simpler to sort through and know what you're looking at.

To conclude, React is really cool, fast, and practical. It's no surprise it dominates the market. Well worth putting to use!
